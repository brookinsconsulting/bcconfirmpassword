BC Confirm Password FAQ

- You can create a settings override of bcconfirmpassword.ini.append.php and customize the re-confirm password timeout limit by changing the number of minutes in the ReConfirmTimeInMinutes setting variable.

- We can implement clearing the session variable which stores the timestamp check upon logout so that each time you login you are forced to re-confirm if users desire this feature. Currently the session variable persists upon logout.
